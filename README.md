## Project Description(s)

### [01 - TV, Halftime Shows, and the Big Game](https://github.com/nitishmalpotra/DS-mini-projects/tree/main/01%20-%20TV%2C%20Halftime%20Shows%2C%20and%20the%20Big%20Game)

Whether or not you like football, the Super Bowl is a spectacle. There's drama in the form of blowouts, comebacks, and controversy in the games themselves. There are the ridiculously expensive ads, some hilarious, others gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and weird. The half-time shows with the biggest musicians in the world, sometimes [riding giant mechanical tigers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZD1QrIe--_Y&feature=youtu.be&t=14) or [leaping from the roof of the stadium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjrdywp5nyE&feature=youtu.be&t=62). And in this project, we will find out how some of the elements of this show interact with each other. We will answer questions like:

- What are the most extreme game outcomes?
- How does the game affect television viewership?
- How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?
- Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?

The dataset used in this project was scraped and polished from Wikipedia. It is made up of three CSV files, one with [game data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_champions), one with [TV data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_television_ratings), and one with [halftime musician data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_halftime_shows) for all 52 Super Bowls through 2018.

### 03 - Predict if the client will subscribe to a term deposit based on the analysis of the marketing campaigns

##### Case Study: Bank Marketing
An international bank has done a multi-touch phone campaign. All the campaign and customer data has been recorded. Based on this, we need to understand whether the customer has subscribed to the term deposit or not.

##### Business Problems
- Run optimized campaigns to bring in more customers, and thereby increase the bank revenue ?
- Increase long-term holdings which can be further invested in different financial instruments?

##### Business Impact
- Improve prediction -> identify common features of subscribing customers -> targeted campaigns
- Improve prediction -> identify right target audience-> efficient budget for marketing
- Improve prediction-> identify right frequency interval for campaign -> optimum campaign
